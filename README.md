# Next.js App with NextAuth Authentication

## Overview

This is a boilerplate Next.js application set up with NextAuth for authentication. It provides a simple starting point for building secure web applications with user authentication.

## Features

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- **NextAuth**: An authentication library for Next.js applications, providing built-in support for various authentication providers such as Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **MongoDB (optional)**: If you choose to use a database, MongoDB is a popular choice. However, NextAuth supports other databases as well.
- **Session Management**: NextAuth handles session management out of the box, making it easy to secure routes and access user data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- MongoDB (optional, if you choose to use a database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pankajgurav005/next-auth-flow-nextAuth.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
